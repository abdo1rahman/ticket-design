1- In order to position any element in a place very different from its usual one, set its parent's
position to _relative_ and its own position to _absolute_

2-When you want to resize a centered element, you have to remeber to center it _again_.
3-When you want to move some content around, and that content has a bg, remeber that the bg is _not attatched to the content_, so you have to move both the same way
